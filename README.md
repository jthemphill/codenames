Very quick and dirty way to set up a game of Codenames. Codenames was made by Vlaada Chvatil, not me, you should totally buy Codenames when it comes out / is no longer sold out, etc.

Usage:
======

You'll need Python.

If you have a terminal, run

    python grid.py good-words/*

Easy ways to help
=================

* I don't have the official words. Every game I've played with the words in good-words.txt has been fun, but feel free to pull request unfun words.
* I use a mac, so I'm not sure what the experience is for non-programmers or Windows users. Maybe the colors are bad? Open an issue if there's something wrong.
* I think a web interface could be nice. If you want a web interface, open an issue or comment on the issue.
